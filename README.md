+ This repository contains the code, result, and report files for the project on assessing the socioeconomic vulnerability to the impacts of extreme flooding in rural/remote areas
  of Indian cities.
+ This research was a data-intensive project where I conducted statistical analysis of a high-resolution (0.25*0.25, daily) spatiotemporal precipitation dataset
  (historical and projected from CMIP5 models, RCP 8.5 scenario, 100 years of data) for the data masked for Indian subcontinental region. Alongside, census data was analyzed to evaluate socioeconomic index of the region.
+ Through this analysis of climate using GEV (Generalized Extreme Value theorem) and socio-economic data, I obtained climate and socioeconomic index of each region which was then aggregated to the district level
  by following the bottom-up approach. Aggregating socio-economic and climate index resulted in desired vulnerability index for each district for the desired period.
+ Results are presented in the form of maps with different hues based on vulnerability level and can be found in one of the folders.
+ All the analysis was performed using Python and R.
+ This research work received special recognition from the 'Gujarat Disaster Management Authority' and was contributed to policy-makers to aid in designing Gujarat state's climate action plan.
